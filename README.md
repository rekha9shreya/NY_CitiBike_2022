# NY_CitiBike_2022

## Objective of the project:
Imagine you’re the lead analyst for a bike-sharing service based in New York City, USA. Your
team has been tasked with analyzing user behavior to help the business strategy department
assess the current logistics model of bike distribution across the city and identify expansion
opportunities.
The project’s objective is to conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data and discover
actionable insights for the business strategy team to help make informed decisions that will
circumvent availability issues and ensure the company’s position as a leader in eco-friendly
transportation solutions in the city
