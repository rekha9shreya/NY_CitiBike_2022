# New York CitiBike 2022

## Introduction:
Imagine you’re the lead analyst for a bike-sharing service based in New York City, USA. Your
team has been tasked with analyzing user behavior to help the business strategy department
assess the current logistics model of bike distribution across the city and identify expansion
opportunities.

## Objection of the Project: 
The project’s objective is to conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data and discover
actionable insights for the business strategy team to help make informed decisions that will
circumvent availability issues and ensure the company’s position as a leader in eco-friendly
transportation solutions in the city

## Key Questions: 
1. Identify the busiest and least busiest stations, does the location of the station impact how busy the station is?
2. Are there any trends among members and non-members?
3. What are the most popular days of the month, what is the busiest month of the year?
4. Does weather impact the bike trends, is there any correlation between the weather and how busy a station is?
